# Strong-Motion Records ‚Äì Illapel Earthquake (Chile, 2015)

This repository contains the baseline-corrected acceleration records used in the doctoral thesis of **Juan Pablo Reyes Cancino**, related to the seismic event of **September 16, 2015 (Mw 8.4) in Illapel, Chile**.

The dataset includes time series of ground acceleration (in m/s¬≤) for both North and East components, as well as metadata such as station name, geographic location, and hypocentral distance.

## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset Structure

Each station has its own `.txt` file named as `StationCode.txt`.  
The structure of each file is as follows:

StationName Centro Deportivo Municipal Pisco Elqui
StationCode C14O
Latitude -30.123091
Longitude -70.490608
Rhypo_km 205.501755

Time_s Acceleration_North_mps2 Acceleration_East_mps2
0.000000 -8.88E-05 -7.46E-07
...


At the end of each file, a reference note is included.
